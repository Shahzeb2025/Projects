**Bike Demand Prediction using Machine Learning & Deep Learning**

This project focuses on predicting daily bike rental demand using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. It includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of both a Neural Network and a Random Forest Regressor, culminating in an ensemble model for improved prediction accuracy.

**Overview**

The goal of this project is to accurately forecast the number of bikes rented daily based on various environmental and temporal features. By leveraging both traditional machine learning and modern deep learning approaches, the project aims to demonstrate robust predictive capabilities.

**Dataset Information**

This data has beeen taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

**Features and Methodology**

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Initial data loading from a CSV file, with conversion of date columns and extraction of relevant time-based features.
**Feature Engineering:**
Creation of is_weekend to identify weekend days.
Extraction of week_of_year to capture weekly patterns.
Generation of lagged features (cnt_lag1) and rolling mean features (cnt_rolling_3) of the bike count to incorporate temporal dependencies.
**Data Cleaning:** 
Irrelevant columns such as instant, dteday, yr, casual, and registered are dropped to streamline the dataset.
**Feature Transformation:**
Numerical features are scaled using MinMaxScaler.
Categorical features are encoded using OneHotEncoder to prepare them for model training.
A ColumnTransformer is utilized for efficient preprocessing of both numerical and categorical features.
**Model Development:**
**Neural Network (Deep Learning):** A sequential Keras model with multiple dense layers and dropout for regularization. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with Huber loss and incorporates EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting.
**Random Forest Regressor (Machine Learning):** A robust ensemble learning method used as a benchmark and for its strong predictive performance.
**Ensemble Modeling:** A simple ensemble approach is implemented by averaging the predictions from the trained Neural Network and Random Forest models, aiming to combine their strengths and enhance overall performance.
**Model Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using common regression metrics:
R² Score
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
